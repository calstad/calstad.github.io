      <description>Hello! I am currently a graduate student in the Mathematics Department at the College of Charleston, working under the supervision of Ben Cox. I am also a Haskell engineer at Seller Labs.
My current research project is in algebraic categorification and higher representation theory, especially as it applies to questions in Lie theory. I am also interested in the applications of computers in pure mathematics research, especially the open source mathematics software system Sage, as well as the use of proof assistants like Coq and Lean.</description>
